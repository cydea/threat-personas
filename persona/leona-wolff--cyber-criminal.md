## Narrative

Leona recently took over as head of the notorious Wolff crime family. She knows that shaking down local shop owners for protection
money isn’t the future: they need to diversify and digitise!

The Wolff’s are motivated purely by financial gain and are very happy with their life of crime.

They are protected by ‘legitimate’ business interests, corrupt lawyers and - in cyberspace - being distant from their victims.
