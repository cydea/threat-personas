## Narrative

Bret is a highly skilled offensive security/computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.

He might compromise systems without permission and without scope limitation for the thrill of gaining privileged access into his target.

He might not inform their victims that they have been compromised and his
goal is to maintain his presence (persistence) into the company systems
and networks while going completely unnoticed for the thrill of it. He
might even apply security updates to ensure that heâ€™s the only attacker
who has access to the systems.
