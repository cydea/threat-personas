# Threat Personas

_Threat personas_ are a tool to improve communication when discussing cyber security threats.

We use simple language, rather than practitioner terminology, so that they are accessible to infosec, technology and business teams alike. Their narrative-driven approach paints a rich picture that is easy for anyone to understand.

They fit between high-level labels (like cyber-criminal) and specific threat actor groups (like Tangerine Flamingo).


## Why?

Often infosec practitioners, developers and business colleagues lack a clear picture of who they are trying to defend their organisation from.

This project contains the _threat persona_ output from the Open Security Summit 2020 session [Threat Personas and Application Vulnerability Scoring Model
](https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso-and-risk-management/user-sessions/threat-personas-and-application-vulnerability-management/), by [Phil Huggins](https://twitter.com/oracuk) and [Robin Oldham](https://twitter.com/rto). We had the objective to educate participants on personas and to create skeleton 'personas' for different threat actors.

An example set of threat personas, created byOSS2020 participants, can be found in [this PDF](https://github.com/cydea/threat-personas/blob/master/OSS2020%20Threat%20Personas.pdf).

We have found from experience that threat personas are a useful tool in a variety of use cases. We want to provide a collection of personas that teams can pick up, tailor, and use within their organisations without having to reinvent the wheel.


## Usage

Pick up and use these example personas within your own organisation!

You may find some of the narratives, or characteristics, don't fit with your business operations and so you may find it beneficial to tailor them to your specific organisational environment.

We welcome contributions to this collection. If you've created a new threat persona then please raise a PR.
